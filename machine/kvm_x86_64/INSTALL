Installing ONIE on KVM x86_64 Virtual Machine
=============================================

Cross-Compiling ONIE
====================

Change directories to ``build-config`` to compile ONIE.

To compile ONIE first change directories to ``build-config`` and then
type ``"make MACHINE=kvm_x86_64 all"``.  For example::

  $ cd build-config
  $ make -j4 MACHINE=kvm_x86_64 all recovery-iso

When complete, the ONIE binaries are located in
``build/images``::

-rw-r--r-- 1 3963992 Jan 30 16:38 kvm_x86_64-r0.initrd
-rw-r--r-- 1 3091328 Jan 30 10:58 kvm_x86_64-r0.vmlinuz
-rw-r--r-- 1 7067253 Jan 30 16:38 onie-updater-x86_64-kvm_x86_64-r0
-rw-r--r-- 1 17825792 Apr 25 09:56 onie-recovery-x86_64-kvm_x86_64-r0.iso

kvm_x86_64-r0.vmlinuz -- This is the ONIE kernel image

kvm_x86_64-r0.initrd  -- This is the ONIE initramfs (filesystem)

onie-updater-x86_64-kvm_x86_64-r0 -- This is the ONIE self-update
image.  This image is a self-extracting archive used for installing
ONIE.

onie-recovery-x86_64-kvm_x86_64-r0.iso -- This is a recovery ISO image
that can be install as a CDROM image.

Creating a New x86_64 Virtual Machine Using the ISO Image
=========================================================

The ISO image can be used with both legacy BIOS and UEFI firmware
machines.

In order to boot qemu with UEFI firmware you need to download the OVMF
firmware from http://www.tianocore.org/ovmf/ .

To create the VM:

1. Create a 256MB blank disk image to use as the "hard drive" for your VM.
   Name the file onie-x86-demo.img, putting it somewhere in your home
   directory::

     $ dd if=/dev/zero of=$HOME/kvm/onie-x86-demo.img bs=1M count=256

2. edit mk-vm.sh and:

   - set the "DISK" variable to point at the path you used in step 1.

   - set the "CDROM" variable to point at the
     onie-recovery-x86_64-kvm_x86_64-r0.iso ISO image.

   - set the "mode" variable to "cdrom".  This will boot off the ISO
     image.

   [ For Booting with UEFI Firmware ]

   - set the "OVMF" variable to point at the path of the OVMF.fd
     firmware file.

   - set the "firmware" variable to "uefi".

3. run mk-vm.sh

4. From the boot menu select the "embed" option to install ONIE to the
   blank VM disk.

5. After the install is complete kill the virtual machine and edit
   mk-vm.sh, setting "mode" to "disk".  This will boot the VM from the
   disk image.

  This will create and launch a VM called "onie-x86-test".

Creating a New x86_64 Virtual Machine Using iPXE
================================================

This example assumes you have configured a DHCP server and a HTTP
server.  The DHCP server is nice to have, but not required.  The HTTP
server is required.

First copy the above build products to the root of your web server.
Here we assume the root of the web server is /var/www::

  $ cp kvm_x86_64-r0.vmlinuz kvm_x86_64-r0.initrd onie-updater-x86_64-kvm_x86_64-r0 /var/www

Next copy the provided ipxe installer script to the same directory::

  $ cp install.ipxe /var/www

.. note:: You will need to edit install.ipxe and change the
          onie-updater URL for your environment.  In the setting of
          the ``onie_url`` variable replace the string "<image-base>" with
          the IP address of your webserver.

When running under QEMU the virtual machine initially boots into
SeaBIOS, which has ipxe installed.  See http://www.ipxe.org/ for
complete details about ipxe.

1. Create a 256MB blank disk image to use as the "hard drive" for your VM.
   Name the file onie-x86-demo.img, putting it somewhere in your home
   directory::

     $ dd if=/dev/zero of=$HOME/kvm/onie-x86-demo.img bs=1M count=256

2. edit mk-vm.sh and:

   - set the "DISK" variable to point at the path you used in step 1.

   - set the "mode" variable to "disk".  This will try to boot off the
     unitialized hard disk.

3. run mk-vm.sh -- NOTE: After starting this script you need to be
   *fast* (5 seconds) to complete steps 4 and 5.

4. connect to the vnc output of the VM::

   vncviewer :0  (you can change the VNC_PORT in mk-vm.sh)

5.  On the vnc console you wil see the SeaBIOS splash screen, followed
    by the ipxe splash screen.  Type <ctrl>-B now.

6.  That should drop you to iPXE prompt

7.  Configure the network interface.  This example assumes you have a
    DHCP server configured.  If not, use the ipxe ``config`` command
    to set up the network parameters.  At the ipxe prompt type::

    iPXE> dhcp

7.  Download and run the install.ipxe script.  The URL of the
    install.ipxe depends on your environment.  Use the IP address of
    your HTTP server::

    iPXE> chain http://<web-server-IP-address>/install.ipxe

The install.ipxe should now download and commence running.  The ipxe
script will do the following:

1.  Download kvm_x86_64-r0.vmlinuz

2.  Download kvm_x86_64-r0.initrd

3.  Boot into ONIE using the "ONIE update" mode, passing the URL of
    the ONIE self-update image in the ``install_url`` kernel command
    line arguemt.

Once ONIE has booted it will:

1.  Detect that it is running in "ONIE update" mode

2.  Find the ``install_url`` command line argument

3.  Proceed to perform the update using the
    onie-updater-x86_64-kvm_x86_64-r0 image.  This update procedure
    will install ONIE on the virtual hard drive.

Once the ONIE update is complete the machine reboots.  This time you
will see the GRUB menu and the machine will boot of the hard drive.
The default GRUB entry boots the machine into "ONIE install" mode.
