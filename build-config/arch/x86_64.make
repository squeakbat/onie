# These are passed to grub, the ONIE Linux kernel, and the demo OS
# grub and kernel (in other words, everything that uses the console).
# The default values are defined here.  They can be overridden by the
# platform's machine.make.
#
# CONSOLE_DEV is 0 or 1, corresponding to Linux /dev/ttyS[01].
# They always map to serial devices at 0x3f8 and 0x2f8, respectively,
# without any BIOS shenanigans.
#
# CONSOLE_PORT is the serial device IO port address.  It is derived
# from CONSOLE_DEV.  So there's no need to define it unless
# you have a weird platform or you're just a nudnik.
